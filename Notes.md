Things I did

# Created a Vite Project with TypeScript and React
# Created empty files for the components I think I need
# Installed styled-components
# Installed MUI 
# Installed Axios 
# Checked how the API works 
# Got a very basic list working 
# got basic functionality for colour filtering 
# would like to implement multiple colours in the filter, maybe like a tagging 
# system for the filter instead of just buttons ? Tags that can be closed? 
# Added Price and discounted price to Product card
# Made the colour list better 
# Added more product options
# Updated styling
# Would also like to have a loading state for the pictures, as right now they are # just popping in randomly when they load. 
# Also no pagination yet
# Also, there is a bug where colour options are saved even when we select a new 
# product to view
